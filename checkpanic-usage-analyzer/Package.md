Detect and report warnings for each usage of the `checkpanic` construct.

# Package Overview
This package contains a Ballerina compiler plugin that detects and reports warnings for any usage of the `checkpanic` construct in Ballerina.

To engage this plugin with the compiler, you need to add an import declaration in one of your source files. 

```
import ballerina/os;
import ballerina/io;

import samjs/checkpanic_analyzer as _;

string host = os:getEnv("HOST");
int port = checkpanic int:fromString(os:getEnv("PORT"));

public function main() {
    checkpanic connect(host, port);
}

function connect(string host, int port) returns error? {
    if host == "" {
        return error("Invalid argument. Host cannot be empty");
    }

    io:println(string `Connected to ${host}:${port}`);
}

```

Here is the `bal build` output:
```
â†’ bal build
